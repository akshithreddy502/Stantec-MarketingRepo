# Marketing Coding Test #
## The Challenge: Modify a Web-based Search App ##

This .NET Core demo app uses [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) to index data from the included FilmsInfo.csv file into a search engine. When you run the app, press the reload button to load the data into the search engine. After that, you can enter search terms and press the search button to search for matching movie results. 

This coding test should take 2 hours. For this test, add as many of the basic features as possible in the time allotted. If you have extra time, select one of the advanced features to implement. If you wish to include extra JavaScript libraries, feel free to use a CDN.

## Basic Features: :seedling: ##
1. Display **Voting Average** in the returned search results.
2. Finsh conecting the **Voting Average (Minimum)** so that it filters the results that are below the minimum selected values. 
1. Add **Release Date** to the index and display it in the returned search results. _(:bulb: Hint: You will need to reload the index after making changes to the indexing code.)_
1. Add a way to filter the search by date range for **Release Date**.
1. Show off your css skills - improve the styling and layout of the page and/or search results. 

## Advanced Features: :mortar_board: ##
1. Autocomplete  - suggest search terms as the user types in the search box.
1. Stemming - when searching for “engineer”, the search should also return results for “engineering”, “engineers”, and “engineered”.
1. Spell checking - present corrected search terms for user misspellings.
